1.  A libary of BMP-related data types based on Microsofts

2.  Using these alternative Datatypes gives a fixed size for every
implementation of these Data types and can be used accordingly.

3.  BYTE = 1 byte, DWORD = 4 bytes, LONG = 4 bytes, WORD = 2 bytes

4.  Hexadecimal : 0x42 0x4D , ASCII : BM

5.  bfSize is the size of the bitmap file in bytes
biSize is the size required by the bitmap structure

6.  When biHeight ist negative the memory origin is in the top left
corner, and the picture is NOT on it's head

7.  biBitCount specifies the BMP's color depth

8.  When the files in argv cannot be found

9.  because we are only reading one element

10. 1

11. goes to a certain value of a file

12. SEEK_CUR sets the origin of fseek at the current position
