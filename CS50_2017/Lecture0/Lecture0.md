# Lecture 0

## Problemset 0

1. Program in Scrtach

2. Your project must have at least two sprites, at least one of which must resemble something other than a cat.

3. Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).

4. Your project must use at least one condition, one loop, and one variable.

5. Your project must use at least one sound.

6. Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be less complex than Oscartime and Pokemon Go. As such, your project should probably use a few dozen puzzle pieces overall.

## Notes:

I programmed a game with a crab and a beachball. The beachball bounces off the edges
and the crab. If the ball bounces off of the crab, the score increases by 1. The size
of the crab and the ball decreases slightly each time the score increases

If the ball touches the ground (or more precise, comes near to it),
the ball's position aswell as the score gets reset.

The game meets the requirements of the Problemset and exceeds the complexity of the
project examples in the Problemset.

The game is playable [Here](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/147309319/)
